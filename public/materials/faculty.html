                The faculty of Government Polytechnic, Nizamabad, is its strongest asset. The teaching staff consists of
                highly qualified lecturers and senior instructors with specialized expertise in engineering and applied
                sciences. Many hold advanced degrees and certifications, and they actively update their knowledge
                through
                workshops, seminars, and research engagements. </p>
            <p> Faculty members follow a student-centric teaching methodology, blending lectures with hands-on
